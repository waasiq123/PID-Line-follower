# PID-Line-follower
A high-speed ESP32-based robot that follows a predefined track using PID control and the SmartElex RLS-08 sensor array. Built with L298N motor drivers and a lightweight chassis, it's optimized for precision and stability.

This repository contains all the code, circuit diagrams, and resources for my **ESP32-based line follower bot** using **PID control** for efficient and precise line tracking.  

Features :
- **ESP32 + SmartElex RLS-08 Sensor Array** for accurate line detection  
- **Dual-motor setup with L298N motor driver**  
- **Optimized PID control for smooth movement**  
- **Lightweight 3D-printed chassis for speed and stability**
